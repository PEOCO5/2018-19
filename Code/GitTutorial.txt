Git Tutorial

1. Install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. Click on the download and choose your preferred settings appropriately
3. Locate your Git folder and open Git Bash (if this doesn't work, open the bin folder and run the bash in there)
   The Bash is where you will run all your commands
4. Go to https://github.com and create/login to your account
5. Create a GitHub repository and title it whatever you want
6. In your gitbash type `git config --global user.name "Syosset Syborgs"` then press enter
   Then type `git config --global user.email "syborg10696@gmail.com"`
   (I think it's pretty obvious that you should change what's in the quotes)
7. Go back to GitHub and click *Clone or download*, then copy the link
8. In you Git Bash, type `git clone "insert the link you copied here"`
   This will create a folder of your repository with all your files in it
9. You can create a file by typing `touch myFile.java`
